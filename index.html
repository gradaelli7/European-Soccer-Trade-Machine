            <h2>Welcome to European Soccer Trade Machine!</h2>
            <p>One of the best ways to gain a competitive advantage in professional sports such as soccer is to identify undervalued players that are particularly well suited to the teamâ€™s needs. In this project, we have developed a tool for recommending strong transfers in European soccer leagues, based on factors including teams' financial resources, players' market values, positions, and performance statistics (appearances, goals, position-specific stats, etc.). Our tool utilizes a machine learning model to determine the characteristics that are most likely to predict a winning trade. We then implement a CSP algorithm involving constraints regarding team positional and financial needs in order to determine optimal potential transfers. This tool is valuable for general managers and front office staff for making transfer decisions based on factors such as positional needs, financial constraints, and season ambitions.</p>
